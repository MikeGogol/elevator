This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It's on typescript template dedicted for CRA https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/

## ElevatorApp

This is my vision of MVP for elevator controller interface.
This interface is dynamic - could be used for any number of elevators and floors.
I tried following minimal design principals.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Please make sure that before you run the App the backend is already running.

The address of backend service should be placed as "host Adress" in httpService.js
